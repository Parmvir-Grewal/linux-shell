# Software Tools and Systems Programming Project

● Designed a fully functional shell in C, including dynamic memory allocation for variable storage and error handling and
incorporated advanced features such as recursive file traversal, background processing, and multi-connection server capabilities. 

● Implemented a wide range of functionalities that outperform built-in shells in many ways, including the ability to handle complex
tasks with ease. Built-in commands such as echo, ls, cd, cat, wc, pipes, bg, kill, ps, and exit demonstrate the breadth of functionality and versatility of the shell, displaying excellent critical thinking skills.
