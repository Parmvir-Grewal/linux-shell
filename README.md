# Fully Functional Shell in C
This is a fully functional shell implemented in C, with a wide range of features and functionalities. It includes dynamic memory allocation for variable storage and error handling, as well as advanced features such as recursive file traversal, background processing, and multi-connection server capabilities.

## Features
- Built-in commands such as echo, ls, cd, cat, wc, pipes, bg, kill, ps, and exit, demonstrating the breadth of functionality and versatility of the shell
- Ability to handle complex tasks with ease, outperforming built-in shells in many ways
- Recursive file traversal for easy navigation of directories
- Background processing, allowing users to execute multiple commands simultaneously
- Multi-connection server capabilities, allowing for remote access and control of the shell

## Getting Started
To use the shell, simply download the repository and compile the source code using the "MakeFile". The shell can then be run from the command line, just like any other shell.

## How to Use
Using the shell is similar to using any other shell. Users can enter commands and arguments, and the shell will execute them. Built-in commands can be accessed using their respective keywords, such as "echo" or "ls". More complex tasks can be accomplished using pipes and other advanced features.
